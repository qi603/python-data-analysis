      " |      \n",
      " |      Note that while an id is optional, we strongly recommend you supply a\n",

      " |      \n",

      " |      \n",
      " |      You can create a 'blank' SeqRecord object, and then populate the\n",

      " |      L\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |      This is just a shortcut for iterating over the sequence directly:\n",

Basically they contain more abstract and detailed information about the SeqRecord object (and thus the sequence).

For the sake of completeness, we'll give a short example here, however we consider features to be part of an even more detailed course.
