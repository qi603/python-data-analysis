# Python for downstream data-analaysis
This repository contains the materials for the course 'Python for downstream data-analysis' given on 25 February and 04 March 2021. 

## Materials
The materials are part of a two day workshop, however you can follow each day separately:
- Day 1: Data science with `pandas` and `seaborn` (chapters 01, 02, 03).  
- Day 2: Python for biological questions with `Biopython` (chapters 04-08).  

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python. We encourage you to follow our extensive [Gentle hands-on introduction to Python programming](https://github.com/vibbits/python-data-analysis/) workshop if you have no experience at all. 
- For the second day it helps if you have some understanding of very basic molecular biological processes (transcription, translations) and how a fasta-file, fastq-file, etc. looks like. 

## Installation instructions
This materials are created in Jupyter Notebooks or JupyterLab, please follow the instructions below to install Jupyter & get started. 

1. Go to [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), scroll down to the Anaconda Installers section, select the right distribution system (Windows, MacOS or Linux) and download the latest Python version.

2. Open Anaconda Navigator. From here you can choose to launch either a JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook which opens a new tab in your browser. 
3. Find the training materials on our (this) GitHub repository: [python-data-analysis](https://github.com/vibbits/python-data-analysis/)
4. Click the green button *Code* and select *Download ZIP*. Finally, extract the zipped file in a folder accessible by Jupyter.
5. In Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, navigate to the extracted ZIP-files of the course, open the first Notebook and enjoy!

Have fun!
