    "Biopython is a set of freely available tools for biological computation written in Python. It is a distributed collaborative effort to develop Python libraries and applications which address the needs of current and future work in bioinformatics. Before diving into your (biological) data and try analyzing it with complex self-written scripts, it makes sense to search through the [Biopython documentation](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html) and look for out-of-the-box solutions as part of Biopython.  \n",
