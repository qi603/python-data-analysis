    "- Advanced data manipulation and tidying using Pandas\n",
    "- Visualizations using Seaborn (customized with matplotlib)\n",
    "- Working with biological data in Biopython\n",
    "- Being able to write scripts and functions from scratch for specific biological or scientific problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially the latter will be the ultimate outcome for this course. Throughout this course we will challenge you to search for solutions yourself. "

    "- There are three ways in which you can run Python code:\n",
    "    - Directly typing **commands into the interpreter**: *Good for experimenting with the language, and for some interactive work*\n",
    "    - Using a **Jupyter notebook**: *Great for experimenting with the language, and for sharing and learning*\n",
    "    - Typing code **into a file** and then telling the interpreter to run the code from this file: *Good for larger programs, and when you want to run the same code repeatedly*"
